# Abstract.
abstract = "Bacterial species belonging to the genus _Burkholderia_ have been repeatedly reported to be associated with fungi but the extent and specificity of these associations in soils remain undetermined. To assess whether associations between _Burkholderia_ and fungi are widespread in soils, we performed a co-occurrence analysis in an intercontinental soil sample collection. This revealed that _Burkholderia_ significantly co-occurred with a wide range of fungi. To analyse the molecular basis of the interaction, we selected two model fungi frequently co-occurring with _Burkholderia_, _Alternaria alternata_ and _Fusarium solani_, and analysed the proteome changes caused by cultivation with either fungus in the widespread soil inhabitant _B. glathei_, whose genome we sequenced. Co-cultivation with both fungi led to very similar changes in the _B. glathei_ proteome. Our results indicate that _B. glathei_ significantly benefits from the interaction, which is exemplified by a lower abundance of several starvation factors that were highly expressed in pure culture. However, co-cultivation also gave rise to stress factors, as indicated by the increased expression of multidrug efflux pumps and proteins involved in oxidative stress response. Our data suggest that the ability of _Burkholderia_ to establish a close association with fungi mainly lies in the capacities to utilize fungal-secreted metabolites and to overcome fungal defense mechanisms. This work indicates that beneficial interactions with fungi might contribute to the survival strategy of _Burkholderia_ species in environments with sub-optimal conditions, including acidic soils."
