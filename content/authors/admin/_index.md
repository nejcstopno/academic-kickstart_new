Nejc Stopnisek is currently a postdoctoral scholar at the Michigan State University working with [Ashley Shade](http://ashley17061.wixsite.com/shadelab). His research goal is to elucidate and exploit the drivers and consequences of biotic interactions on ecosystem functioning and host wellbeing to mitigate effects of future environmental changes. 

His research is based around plant-microbe interactions and soil microbiome. In particular, he is interested in how: 

i) __tripartite interactions of plant-soil-microbe will be affected by the climate change and what consequences will that have on agroecosystem functioning and crop production__

ii) __microbial driven nutrient cycling under climate change and at macro- and micro- scales in terrestrial systems.__
