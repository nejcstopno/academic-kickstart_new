In this work we investigated the evolutionary trajectories that led to the improved growth in the evolved cocultures of Methanococcus and Desulfovibrio and mechanisms that led to maintenance of diverse populations within theses cocultures.  
This work is a product of excellent collaboration with Serdar Turkarslan and many others within the ENIGMA consortium.
