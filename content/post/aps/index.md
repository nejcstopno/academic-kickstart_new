summary = "The workshop is an all-day session at the start of the APS Annual Meeting. Goals of the workshop include strengthening APS membership understanding of root systems, root foraging and stress adaptation behavior, and recent innovations for studying root phenotyping as well as to share recent innovations in studying root/rhizosphere microbiomes and the direct and indirect ways they contribute to plant health and maintaining plant productivity during stress. The workshop will feature breakout sessions to discuss opportunities for new transformational ideas afforded by this interdisciplinary perspective, future directions for research, and how can we continue to work together in an interdisciplinary manner. The organisers of the workshop are Linda Kinkel, Leland Pierson, and Larry York."
