title: Presenting at the APS workshop: __The Plant Root System: Gateway to Plant-Beneficial Rhizosphere Microbiome Interactions__
event: APS Annual meeting
event_url: https://example.org
location: Cleveland, Ohio
summary: The workshop is an all-day session at the start of the APS Annual Meeting. Goals of the workshop include strengthening APS membership understanding of root systems, root foraging and stress adaptation behavior, and recent innovations for studying root phenotyping as well as to share recent innovations in studying root/rhizosphere microbiomes and the direct and indirect ways they contribute to plant health and maintaining plant productivity during stress. The workshop will feature breakout sessions to discuss opportunities for new transformational ideas afforded by this interdisciplinary perspective, future directions for research, and how can we continue to work together in an interdisciplinary manner. The organisers of the workshop are Linda Kinkel, Leland Pierson, and Larry York.
abstract: "Despite recognition of the importance of the plant root system as the gateway to plant-beneficial interactions with the rhizosphere microbiome, the complexity of root classes that constitute a plantâ€™s root system and the importance of deciphering how this complexity shapes microbiome recruitment and plant responses to microbiome services may be overlooked by rhizosphere microbiologists. At the same time, although it is widely recognized that plants actively recruit ecological services provided by the rhizosphere microbiome, the role of the microbiome in mediating changes in root system architecture (RSA) at the cellular to system levels, as well as in whole plant physiology and multitrophic interactions may be overlooked by plant physiologists and breeders. The workshop brings together root and microbiome researchers for in-depth discussion of root system structure and function, including major differences among plants in RSA,genetic, environmental, and microbiome controls on RSA, RSA adaptive responses to plant stress, how these can be manipulated by rhizosphere microorganisms to confer beneficial phenotypes, and what root system traits to measure to quantify these changes. The workshop invites interdisciplinary discussion."
